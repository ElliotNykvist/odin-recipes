a basic recipe website

I will build a basic recipe website with the help of basic html and while
doing so, I will use git commit, to learn how to do commits and learn when 
to make them. 

The website will consist of a main index page whitch will have links to few
recipes. I wont look pretty until I have learned CSS.
